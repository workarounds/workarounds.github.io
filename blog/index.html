        <div class="text"><p>She closed the door, <a href="#">locked it, and put the key</a> carefully in the pocket of her dress. And
            so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she started on her journey.</p>

            <h3>Some takeaways</h3>

            <p>There were several roads near by, but it did not take her long to find the one paved with yellow bricks.
                Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily
                on the hard, yellow road-bed. The sun shone bright <em>and</em> the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did not feel
                nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenly whisked away from her own
                country and set down in the midst of a strange land.</p>

            <p>She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was about her. There were neat
                fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty blue color, and beyond them were fields of grain and
                vegetables in abundance. Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops. Once
                in a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her and bow low as she went by;
                for everyone knew she had been the means of destroying the Wicked Witch and setting them free from
                bondage. The houses of the Munchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for
                a roof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was the favorite color.</p></div>
