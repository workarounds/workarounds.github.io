        <h5 class="small-pad-bottom">Design intensive • Android • Dictionary APIs</h5>

        <p>
            Define is an offline android dictionary app that's been in beta for a while. The idea is to
            emulate a system wide dictionary for android. The major features are: use of chatheads to
            show the meanings of the word in any app, have multiple offline dictionaries that the user
            can choose from. Use a few APIs like wiki and urban dictionary that either can't be offline
            or too huge for offline use.

                Swarachakra
            </a> is a keyboard for Indic languages. The app has been out for a while and is doing
            pretty decently. But it lacks important functions like prediction and user dictionaries. Other
            than that the repo was in pretty bad shape previously. Moving it to Android studio helped a lot.
            Now the repo can be made open source without us feeling ashamed.

                Instimap
            </a> and <a href="http://instilive.com/" target="_blank">Instilive</a> as they stand are two separate
            looking apps. But we intend to merge them
            to create one seamless experience. The major focus is on pushing customized notifications to students.
            Few people with PORs (like hostel secretaries, Insti secys) will be given posting rights and they will
            be able to push a notification to all the users who are interested in that particular field. This requires
            work on LDAP and facebook integration. Most of the work on the back-end is done. We also intend to make a
            chrome extension for the same. This would probably be the primary focus of this summer.

        <p>
            We do a lot of free lancing. And we will continue this through summers. There are multiple
            budding startups that are our clients. So exposure to the "Powai valley" thingy going on will
            be abundant.
